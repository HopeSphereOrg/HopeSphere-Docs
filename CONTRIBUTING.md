## 📝 Documentation Guidelines
### 1. **Structure Requirements** 📄
- Use **Markdown (`.md`)** format for documentation.
- Follow the **existing folder structure** when adding new pages.
- Each page should have a **clear and concise title** as a top-level header (`#` Heading 1).

- Use **triple backticks** for code blocks and specify the language.
- Example:

- Check **spelling and grammar** using tools like Grammarly or LanguageTool.
